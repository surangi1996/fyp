22,12,"Archery for BEGINNERS If you'd like to get into archery as a hobby but you have no idea where to begin, we absolutely understand how you feel. A lot of people are really excited to grab a bow and start shooting, but feel confused by all the terms and equipment and measurements. After all-there's a lot to know! 2 Recurve Bows Easier to buy and use. They need less tuning, and with many models. you can put them together ""right out of the box"" and start shooting. That sort of simplicity is fantastic for a new archer, and you can dive right into the sport. we almost always suggest the Samick Sage Recurve Bow. It's easy to use, easy to set up, and it's easy to accessorize. The Two Main TYPES OF BOWS D Recurve Bows These are the types of bows you see in the Olympics. They have a sleek, graceful design and they're mostly used for target shooting, although some experienced hunters use them for bow hunting. These bows are a favorite among bow hunters, because they are able to shoot with incredible speed and force. That said, there are plenty of people who use compound bows for target shooting and competition shooting. The Parts OF A BOW is you Bow RECOMMENDATIONS true value to shoot for a bow that .. give you and place appropriate 0.00 n How to get the RIGHT SIZED BOW Draw Length The first measurement, draw length, refers to the distance to which you can comfortably pull back the bow string. Draw length is important because in order to make accurate shots. 4 There are two ways to determine your draw length Go to an archery store and have a bow tech measure you with a tool called a ""draw length indicator shaft."" The tool looks like a really long arrow, but it has measurements on it, and the bow tech will be able to determine your draw length using it. Take your height, in inches, and divide by 2.5. If you are, say, six feet tall, that means you're 72 inches tall (6 feet x 12 inches = 72 inches), and 72 divided by 2.5 = 28.8. So if you're six feet tall, you'd select a bow with a draw length of 29 inches (draw length in measured in full inches, so you'd round up from 28.8 to 29). Taking your height in inches and dividing by 2.5 is remarkably accurate, and seems to work for most people. Fletching These made of feathers sometimes they're for hunting). Nock arrows a This that fits into Archery Ranges The easiest guidance require Compound Bows 5 is the back The Riser This is the handle of the bow; it's what you hold when you shoot. The Limbs These are attached to the riser; they form the actual bow, with the top limb attached by the bow string to the bottom limb. The Bow String This is the string that shoots your arrows; it connects the top limb of the bow to the bottom limb of the bow. are the vanes on an arrow; Shaft This is the length of the arrow. that The Nock Point This is the spot on the bow string where you place the end of the arrow. The nocking point needs to stay in the same place, so that you can aim and shoot consistently. Three types OF ARROWS The Bow Sight The bow sight is kind of like the scope on a rifle -after you adjust it properly, the sight allows you to aim at your target. way to go to take of you a range: they'll a few hours. They'll allow you fits your size specifications, match the bow, target distance. at the Compound Bows With their cams and accessories, can be a little more difficult to tune. once you get them tuned right, they can be a lot easier to aim and shoot, and they make it a lot easier to hit your target. For most archers, consistently hitting your target is deeply satisfying! Arrowhead This is the pointy part at the front of an arrow. Arrowheads can be different weights and different shapes, ranging from very blunt to super, super, super sharp. we like the Predator Raptor Compound Bow. It's got an adjustable draw weight- meaning that you can begin at a lower draw weight when you start out, and increase the weight as you gain strength and ability. the bow string. Draw Weight This is the second measurement you'll need to consider when buying a bow. The draw weight is a measurement, in pounds, of how difficult it is to pull the draw string back. A bow with a draw weight of 10 pounds will be very easy to pull and shoot, and a bow with a draw weight of 50 pounds or more will be more difficult to pull and shoot. Children are good with a draw weight from 5-20lbs. Adults 22 and older usually use bows with draw weights of 25 pounds and higher. Arrow TERMS Aluminum Arrows These are great for beginners, and they can be used by people who shoot from a recurve bow, as well as by people who shoot from a compound bow. sometimes they're (thisis good for target practice) and made of plastic (and this is good Wood Arrows The original arrow!

38,136,"A rchery competitions are common competitive events. The rules are simple: competitors fire at a target and score points depending on how close to the center of the target the arrow strikes. The archer with the most points wins. A staple of medieval tournaments, the archery contest draws bowmen from far and wide to test their skill and accuracy. Contests can sometimes attract up fifty or more skilled competitors, and the winner often receives a valuable prize- cash, jewellery or, more commonly, a fine bow or quiver of arrows. In traditional archery contests, contestants fire arrows at a stationary target, though some tournaments use moving targets or have the archers fire from horseback. Usually the target has different locations that are worth different points in a contest, though some contests simply require a contestant to hit the target at all to progress.

Being in a team will teach your kid to lead others, support them and rely on them. In archery, the focus is literally on the target. Archery offers a perfect goal-setting environment.

97,20,"AN EYE ON ARCHERY J DyneemaR was first introduced to the sport of archery in 1995 with its Dynaflight bowstring material, made from SK65 Dyneema. Taking into account its initial purpose of hunting it is surprising to know that archery is actually one of the safest sports, with an injury rate of less than one incident per 1,000 participants, and is practiced by anyone from grade-school children to senior citizens. Archery is at least 5,000 years old (but probably a lot older!) The earliest people known to have used bows and arrows were the ancient Egyptians, who adopted archery at least 5,000 years ago for hunting and warfare. Dyneema' 360 Sources SAFETY /ArcherySafetyInsight.pdf com.au/history.htm THE HISTORY Women in Archery Women competed in the 1904 Olympics, making archery one of the first sports competitions to include women. Myth: To improve their aim, ancient Amazonian women would have one breast removed! Modern female archers accomplish the same thing with chestguards. Archers can fire arrows at more than 250 km/h. More than twice the national speed limit on British motorways. There are now more than 8 million archers worldwide and over 145 countries are part of the World Archery Members Associations. Historically bow strings were made from animal byproducts such as sinew, intestine (catgut), hair or from plant fibers such as linen or hemp. Dyneema 360 http://www.azgfd.gov/pdfs/i_e/archery http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery http://www.centenaryarchers.gil. Archery was first practiced as a sport 400 years ago The first known organised competition in archery was held at Finsbury, England in 1583 and included 3,000 participants. It was first included as an Olympic sport in 1900, discontinued in 1924, and reintroduced in 1972. Archery is more dangerous than Bowling, but less dangerous than Tennis Archery - 0.65 Bowling - 0.31 www.dyneema360.com Tennis - 1.16 Popular Protective Equipment Bracer: An arm-guard that protects the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string Finger Tab: Protects the drawing fingers Chestguard: used by women, primarily to protect the chest E  1 Injury Rate per 1,000 participants http://www.archery.org/UserFiles/ Document/World%20Cup/ http://www.archery.org/ General/WCup_Media_Guide_2012_.pdf",archery

136,34,"Olympic Sports FROM AROUND THE WORLD HI HCHM-ORCHE Archery is one of the oldest sports still practised in modern society. The bow and arrow has been traced back as far as the Paleolithic era around 35,000 to 8000 BC. For the majority of human history archery has been used as a weapon, rather than as a means of competition. The origins of archery are blurry, but there is recorded evidence of archery contests taking place in China around 3000 years ago. The Olympics are an exciting time of the year and the perfect time to go travelling, but that doesn't mean you have to go to Rio. Olympic sports originate from all around the world, meaning you can travel pretty much anywhere and still get the Olympic experience. Archery played an important role in Chinese society. In particular, archery featured prominently in ancient Chinese culture and philosophy: archery was one of the Six Noble Arts of the Zhou dynasty 1146-256 BCE. SIXHOTE Diving SOURCES: MOHAM Gymnastics is just one of many Olympic sports that originated in Greece. Physical fitness was highly valued in ancient Greece and gymnastics was first used as a seri of exercises to develop one's body. The term gymnastics is directly derived from gymnazein, meaning 'to exercise naked'. After Greece was conquered by the Romans, gymnastics was developed into a more formal sport. The Romans used gymnasiums to prepare their legions for warfare. After the decline of Rome, the need for gymnastics dwindled but tumbling has remained as a form of entertainment and competition. Golf In the south of Italy is the image of a young. man diving from a narrow platform painted onto the roof of a burial vault. The discovery of the Tomba Del Tuffatore, The Tomb of the Diver,, shows us that the art of diving from high places and landing gracefully into water has lured people from at least 480 BC. Archery The origins of modern diving can be traced to Sweden. In the late 1890s Otto Hagborg and C.F Mauritzi travelled to London and introduced the world to competitive diving - which was being developed: in Sweden. The Amateur Diving Association was formed in 1901 as a direct result of this visit. http://swimhistory.org/ http://www.scholastic.com/ ASPIRE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT LOUNGES Swissport That being said it is generally accepted that modern golf developed in The Netherlands during the Middle Ages. The game of golf didn't find international popularity immediately. During the 19th century it spread to the United Kingdom and then to the British Empire and the United States. Evidence of early golf in the United States includes a 1739 record for a shipment of golf equipment ""to a William Wallace, the Scottish knight, in South Carolina.  Gymnastics # HEPU+ With most sports dating back to ancient times, little information on Olympic sport origins has survived. Golf has been added to the roster of events for Rio 2016. The origins of golf, as with many other sports, is unclear and much debated. Why not visit one of these historical destinations on your next holiday and find out for yourself.

Your body has a natural centering point and if your feet are not positioned properly, your shot may be directed towards your centering point in a fraction of a second during the shot. There are three basic foot positons all of which should be shoulder's width. Holding Keep the back muscles (rugspieren) under tension. Bow hand, draw hand and elbow should form a straight line. (een rechte lijn) Keep both shoulders as low as possible. 42861/ Drawing Grip the bow handle firmly in the left hand, but don't squeeze. With your bow arm straight, raise the bow to a point that your arm is parallel to the ground, while simultaneously drawing the string back to your ""anchor point"" with your shooting hand. The anchor point may be the corner of your mouth, your cheekbone, or your chin. Draw back your arrov on your bow with your quick release and aim at the target by looking through your ""guide hole"" (this is about at eye level.)

However, some of them can be expensive. BLOCK Classe Size Foam core blocks tend to have a higher price tag thanks to the material from which they are made. 3D targets are the most expensive. The first thing that you should look at is how big the target is going to be. This affects a couple of factors. The larger a target, the heavier it is.

Archery targets often need stands or something simi- lar, to enable you to shoot at them comfortably. Weight also comes into the equation since you will have to carry the target around.

To become really good at archery, you are going to need to shoot thousands of arrows at a target. A lot of bag and foam targets can handle thou- sands of shots, but they are not all made equally. Some targets can handle the damage better than others. Arrow Removal Additionally, since you will be shooting thousands of times over and over, you'll want a target that allows for easy arrow removal. Struggling to take out an arrow can result in damaged arrows. Though arrows can be cheap individually, once you shoot them thousands of times, the price piles up.

The need to learn to follow rules for the purposes of safety and competition to the inner self-discipline that is required to shoot well. PROBLEM SOLVING 04 Success in many sports only comes about after a series of failures. Archery is all about step by step. methods, and learning how small changes influence a final result. 05 LEARNING HOW TO FAIL You won't hit gold every time. Archery teaches kids resilience and the importance of trying again. 1601 SPORTSMANSHIP 06 AND TEAMWORK Working with other archers teaches young people the rules of engagement, teamwork and dealing with both success and failure. 07 IMPROVED PHYSICAL HEALTH An archer can walk as far as five miles in a one day tournament and drawing a bow requires controlled upper body strength. BALANCE, STABILITY 080 AND CO-ORDINATION Stability and balance are top of the list for good shooting not just strength alone. And hand eye co-ordination is essential for archery. 09 DEALING WITH PRESSURE Competitive archers name the ability to deal with pressure as one of the top three factors in successful shooting. PATIENCE 10 Patience is a virtue and in archery, kids have to learn to be patient and wait for the right moment to release the bow and for others to shoot. CONCENTRATION Archery teaches kids how to concentrate, how to maintain and increase their attention span. ?! SELF-CONTROL 120 Archery requires not only total control of the body but also complete control of the mind. 13 SELF-AWARENESS AND CONFIDENCE Learn how they react under pressure, in difficult situations and as a team player. TARGETS AND 14 GOAL SETTING Skill, technique and experience layer one upon another to achieve target prowess. Even for the most competitive child, there is always another goal, another challenge. 15 MENTAL ACUITY AND REACTION TIME The key components in assessing or developing mental acuity are memory, focus, concentration and understanding. Target archery offers the young mind the opportunity to develop really good mental acuity. SAFETY AND 16 RESPONSIBILITY Did you know that archery is actually one of the safest school sports your kids can be involved in? Teaching children about safety makes them take responsibility for their own behaviour and also the safety of those around them. 17 MINDFULNESS The process of shooting a bow is a mindful one. You have to focus on yourself and nothing else. ACCOMPLISHMENT 18 With practice, any kid can get good at archery. It requires work but it is possible to become an accomplished shooter accomplishment is a big positive in a child's life. and having an 19 GET OUTDOORS There are so many health benefits to simply being outside!

COST 22 Start up costs are minimal and even with a child that is keen, it is possible to go a long way into the sport without having to spend a fortune. 23 SELF-IMPROVEMENT Kids like archery because they can easily plot ""getting better at something"" through proper practice. FRIENDSHIP 24 One of the top three reasons why kids like the National Archery in the Schools Program (NASPR) is the friends they make being a part of it. 25 IT'S COOL!

163,6,"Look at Basics of Archery DETERMINING EYE DOMINANCE Make a triangle like this with your hands. Extend your arms toward the target. Look through the hole with both eyes open and focus on the target. Close your left eye. If the target remains in view, you are right eye dominant. If your hand moves off the target, you are left eye dominant. t STANCE Stand perpendicular to the target with your feet on either side of the shooting line about shoulder width apart. Keep your back straight, but don't lock your knees or back. * PRE-DRAW Raise the bow. Put your arms in position. Always grip the string with your three middle fingers, while touching your pinky and thumb to keep your hand staight. J 4 DRAW Draw your bow by pulling the string using your back-NOT your shoulder or arm muscles. Draw the bowstring until it touches the tip of you nose. Nestle your drawing hand under your chin. Keep your elbow straight. ANCHOR The anchor is the final part of the draw. It is where your hand will rest under your chin before you take aim and release the arrow. AIM Concentrate on the target. It often works best to keep both eyes open, not just the dominant eye. RELEASE AND FOLLOW THROUGH To release, relax the drawing hand. Do not fully let go-just let your fingers go limp. Allow the bow to naturally move forward. Keep your drawing hand in place, like the image to the left. Prepared By: saffordsportinggoods.com",archery

194,88,"THE HISTORY OF ARCHERY The exact date when people began using the bow and arrow is hard to determine but it is said to have started in the late Palaeolithic Era (late stone age). The earliest known people to have created the bow was the egyptians. Their bow was made of wood, held together by animal sinew, glue, and bow string made of sheep intestines. The fallowing map shows the years the bow and arrow were an important part of that countries life as well as different ways the bow and arrow were being used. | 1620s European settlers bring their knowledge of bowmaking to the North American continent 1828 The first archery club on the North American continent is the United Bowmen et Philadelphia. 500 A.D the Romans, formerly second-rate archers, began to draw the arrow to the face rather than the chest, giving the shot more accuracy 1588 English troops consisted of one-third bowmen to two-thirds soldiers with guns. Eventually that switched to two-thirds bowmen. 1537 Under King Henry Vill of England's directions, Sir Christopher Morris estab. Sishes the Guild of St. George, the first archery society 3500BC: Egyptions- earliest people known to use bow and arrows for purposes of hunting and warfare 1200BC Hittites use short recurve bow in mobile warfare by shooting from chariots 1800BC Assyrians introduce short recurve-shaped bow providing more power and easier handling 501-600BC Japan introduced and influences Kyujutsu (the art of the bow) method of physical, moral, and spiritual development 1766-1027BC China uses war chariot. Three-man team: driver, lancer, archer. 1027-256 BC nobles at court attended sport archery tournaments that were accompanied by music and interspersed with elegant salutations. IMPORTANT BATTLES 1066 The Battle of Hastings and Duke William of Normandy had the disadvantage of attacking up-hill. Normans determined to shoot their arrows upward into the air, so that they might fall on their enemies' heads and strike their faces. The archers adopted this scheme and shot up into the air toward the English; and the arrows, in falling, struck their heads and faces and put out the eyes of many; and all feared to open their eyes or leave their faces unguarded. King Harold has been shot with an arrow just above his eye which has put it out and many other English soldiers have suffered a similar fate due to the strategy of the Norman archers. Duke William won the battle and conquered the English-this was mainly due to the Norman's use of the Bow and arrow. 1346 The Battle of Crecy: The English army of Edward III won the first major battle of the 100 Years War. After landing with some 12,000 men, including 7,000 archers and taking Caen in Normandy. Edward III moved northwards. The English took a defensive position in three divisions on ground that sloped downwards, with the archers on the flanks. The French first sent out the mercenary Genoese crossbowmen, numbering between 6000 and 12,000 men. With a firing rate of three-five volleys per minute they were however no match for the English and Welsh longbow men who could fire ten-twelve arrows in the same amount of time. After 16 charges and 90 minutes, the French had lost 4000 knights, including 2 Kings, 2 Dukes, and 3 Counts. English losses were estimated at only 50 men. 1356 The Battle of Poitiers in 1356 are in fact quite vague, however it appears that some 10,000 English and Welsh troops, this time led by Edward, Prince of Wales, also known as the Black Prince, were retreating after a long campaign in France with a French army of somewhere between 20,000-60,000 men in close pursuit. The two armies were separated by a large hedge when the French found a gap and attempted to break through. The French, who had developed a small cavalry unit specifically to attack the English and Welsh archers, were not only brought to an abru stop by the number of arrows that showered down upon them. This was also stopped and it is said that so intense was the attack by the English and Welsh archers that at one point some ran out of arrows and had to run forward and collect arrows embedded in people lying on the ground. 1415 The Battle of Agincourt: In what was perhaps known as the greatest victory of the Hundred Years War. The composition of the English forces was 1,000 Men-at-Arms and 5,000 Archers divided into the traditional three ""battles"" with the archers in a wedge pattern flanking each ""Battle"". The siege lasted five weeks, much longer than expected, and Henry lost around 2,000 of his men to dysentery. Just two minor problems lay in their way - a very, very large and angry French army and the River Somme. Some 25,000 Frenchmen faced Henry's 6000. As if things couldn't get worse it started to pour with rain. The battle itself lasted just half an hour and between 6,000 and 10,000 French were killed whilst the English suffered losses in the hundreds. 1501-1600 1644 the bow and arrow as a war weapon began to decline after the invention of firearms. last battle involving bowmen was in Perthshire, Scotland during english civil war MODERN ARCHERY Target archery is the most common type of archery that is performed today and is often referred to as 'Olympic style, as it is the type used in the Olympics. Field archery again involves shooting arrows at targets, but this is usually on rough terrain and the targets are at varying distances (often unmarked) and of varying sizes. This type of archery was initially developed to improve standards in bowhunting, but has since become a very popular, arguably more so than target archery. 3D archery is very similar to field archery but 3D animals are used instead, making it very popular with hunters Usually, unmarked distances for the targets are used in 3D archery and the aim is to recreate a hunting ground as accurately as possible. Clout archery is very similar to target archery, apart from the fact the targets are circles positioned on the ground, surrounding a marker flag which the archer has to drop the arrow into. Fight archery is to shoot the arrow at the longest possible distance. Archers shoot six arrows at each and then the archers go and see where they have landed. They are marked according to which one has been shot the furthest parallel to the datum line. Longbows are characterized by their simplicity: they consist of a long slightly curved piece of wood the same height as the archer and do not have arrow rests or sights. Longbows are much more difficult to aim than other modern bows and do not have nearly the same velocity as compound or recurve bows Recurve bows were historically used by horsemen, and modern versions of the bow are used in Olympic events. These bows are named for their distinct shape: the central parts of the limbs curve toward the archer, and the tips of the limbs curve away from the archer. TE Crossbows are drawn by way of a crank mechanism; the string is then attached to the trigger mech- anism and locked in place until the archer fires. Cross- bows have short firing ranges and need heavier draw weights to perform on the same level as compound and recurve bows. Compound bows were first produced in the 1960s and involve in an inno- vative system of cables, pulleys and eccentric cams that assist the archer in hold- ing a heavy draw weight at full draw. This system gives archers time to aim the pow- erful bow without causing excessive muscle fatigue",archery

For nocks to attach the bowstring, use blanks of horn or hardwood, 1%"" by 5%"" by "", drilled, countersunk, and riveted to the bow with 3/16"" flathead brass stove bolts. Rough them into shape with rasp or sanding wheel. Cut the string grooves with a 7/32"" rat-tail file. Release Nut and Trigger. Ivory makes the best release nut. Substitutes are alumi- num, brass, Babbitt, or phenol-formaldehyde composition. If an old billiard ball is avail- able, it can be turned down at low speed between live and dead centers with a file ground like a parting tool. Make the string and trigger notches as shown. APRIL, 1940 Cut the trigger with a hack saw and finish with a file. A long trigger is necessary be- cause of pressure on the nut. This pressure also requires the use of plate-brass bearings, as diagrammed, for the release-nut axle. The Stock. The stock is cut from 2"" by 8"" by 27"" walnut. Hardwood is preferable because it is easier to groove accurately. Rough out the blank according to the draw- ings, marking holes for the axles of trigger and release nut. Cut the bolt groove with router or saw. Make the initial cut a shallow one, then enlarge it with a 5/16"" rat-tail file. Chisel out trigger and release-nut recesses. Cut bow stirrup plates from 12"" brass as shown and file the slots, enlarging them as necessary to fit the bow; then fit them to the stock. When they fit snugly into their recesses in the stock, bore for the 2"" bolt that fastens stirrups and bow securely in place.

Round the barrel on either side of the groove to reduce friction on the string. Fit the butt plate before finishing the stock with varnish or oil. Jack for Drawing Bowstring. Because of the strength of the steel spring, it is necessary to have some mechanical aid in drawing back the bowstring so as to catch it over the nut. A hinged wooden jack is used for this purpose. It is made as shown in the drawings and used as illustrated. The Bolts. Bolts can be made of 5/16"" commercial doweling or by planing the 137 corners from 11/32"" squares of wood and sanding to size Birch or fir in a chuck. dowels are best. Turn or whittle shoulders for the target points or piles. These can be purchased at sport- ing goods stores or from dealers in archery supplies. Clinch in place with a center punch and cut off the dowels to a length of 9"" from tip to butt. Sand the butt diam- eter to "". A nock is not required for the bowstring. Turkey or goose feathers are best. Use the stiffest of ""flight feathers"" the wing. Select three feath- ers from the same wing of the bird, that is, all right or all left. Lay the feathers on a board, held flat under outstretched finger and thumb, and cut off the rib almost level with the vane, using a sharp knife. Next hold the blade like a pen, guide it by running the sec- ond finger along the flat- tened rib, and cut off the vane and a 1/32"" strip of rib with it. CUT RIB ALMOST LEVEL WITH VANE -134 Finished Feather Another simple method is to strip off the wide part of the feather by pulling its papery root tegument from the rib.

Three finished feathers usually can be cut from the widest part of one vane. Trim the feathers to shape and moisten between layers of damp newspaper. Apply hot glue thinly to the base of a feather, lay it on the shaft, and hold in place for a moment. When the glue has set, sand the bolt again lightly, and paint to suit your fancy. Finish with varnish. The Bowstring. This is made of high- grade linen thread usually specified as ""No. 6 flax repair stitching."" Get about 60 yd. from your shoemaker. Other very strong flax threads can be used. Make the string according to the diagram, and rub the center wrapping with paraffin to re- duce friction on the barrel. String the bow by making a lighter false or temporary string long enough to be slipped over the nocks without bend- ing the bow. Put the true string on the bow, one loop in a nock, the other sliding on a limb. Place the false string over the true and bend bow with the jack until the true string can be set in place. Now jerk out the false string. The crossbow can be left strung all the time. In ancient times, the sporting crossbow was used for hunting or for competitive shooting at the butts.

The Cue Grip DOE Inventor Harold G Barrett &g All The cue needs to be in a straight line with your intended shot When you look down the cue, you will know where the ball will roll after you hit it. Approach and stance should be given a good thought even before you hut the ball Follow the snooker cue tip, be confident by all means and tackle the shot you planned This is a for more important snooker tip than most snooker playing amateurs realise The bridge should be flexible enough to hit the ball deod centre, couse a screw shot, or even a top spin. Right foot near the shot and always straight Left foot in front, knees bent and loose enough to allow the hips to swivel 15 reds Once you have feathered or rehearsed and think you have the ideal position, take the shot. 1 white ball Aim: To accumulate the maximum number of points till the end of the game Y 5. Free ball 199 points points points points points 1. Snooker break off When you never miss, you score the most points. If initially you get a free ball you can very wel make a maximum break of 1551 6 different colored balls Course of the game: The first shot of every snooker game is the break shot & is played from the D between the brown and yellow 3. Safeties A snooker situation arises when you or your opponent is left with no choice but to play the boll on either by hitting a cushion first or by playing a masse shot 7 points If you think that a shot is risky. you can play a safety and come behind the bouk colours if there is no loose red in the boukk 4. Snooker After no reds remain on the table, you have to start potting the colors in increasing order of value storting from yellow all the way to block totalling to 27 points 2. Snooker breaks or runs When your opponent fouls and your boll on cannot be hit half ball on both sides directly, then you con nominate o free boll 6. Potting the colours HOW TO PLAY SAFE IN A GAME OF SNOOKER There are two different types of safety shot to consider, so lets look at them both: 1. An aggressive safety-one that puts your opponent in trouble 2. A negative safety-one that gets you out of trouble So mostly players will look to play aggressive safety's. They will try to open the reds for example but cover any potting opportunities and stop any returns to a safe area. Sometimes a player will deliberately leave an opponent a difficult pot in the knowledge that they might be forced into going for it as they have no other shot and a safety is more difficult. Sometimes if a player has played a safety and has stopped any easy return to boulk and a pot is also very difficult, then a player might opt to play a negative In other words a mini rehearsal, this is safety where they will simply try to get the cue ball safe but they will also know to let you get your eye on the ball that they have not put their opponent in any real trouble (negative safety). and the pockets A very important thing to achieve in a safety is a good cue ball One where the cue ball is tight against the cushion will always cause an opponent difficulty. If one can achieve a good cue ball while covering an open table, then it usually bears fruit,",billiard

989,622,5 CARROM BOARD RULES -STRIKE & POCKET You Should Know!!!,carrom
990,623,"How to Play Two, three or four people can play. In singles, your opponent sits across from you; in doubles, you play opposite your partner. With three, you can play for points. How to arrange the pieces on the board Line up the double whites to aim 'dead-on' into a corner pocket. Whoever plays first, or breaks, is always white. The object of the game is to sink all of your pieces, using the heavier 'striker', in any of the pockets before your opponent. Your turn continues as long as you keep sinking your pieces - luck shots count and all combinations are permitted. When placing the striker on the board to shoot, the striker must touch both 'base lines' (see left diagram), either covering the red circle completely, or not touching it at all. The striker may not touch the diagonal arrow line. Shooting styles are very personal - whichever 'grip' works for you is fine as long as you 'flick' the striker and don't push it. Generally, it's best to orient your body in order to see the line of your aim while shooting comfortably; you may not move or leave your chair. For forward shots, you can use your index finger, middle finger, or even the 'scissors' shot (right). Tip on technique: Before shooting, try touching the striker with your fingernail, to be sure that it's really on line. This will improve your accuracy and prevent you from hurting your finger.",carrom

996,630,"American Carrom American Carrom is a simplified version of the international carrom game that is highly popular around the world. American Carrom was created to play faster and have more simplified rules than the international standard. American Carrom is played on a highly polished surface. The overall size of the board is 30 inches square with the playing surface approximately 26% to 27 inches square. The four pockets in American Carrom are 3 inches in diameter. The drawing at left shows a typical American Carrom board. The line labeled (a) is the shooting line. The circle (b) is approximately 6 1/4 inches in diameter and is used for racking the pieces at start and placing ""scratched"" discs. The spot (o) in the center circle is used to spot the red queen. The pockets (d) are 3 inches in diameter. The diagonal line (c) defines shooter's ""seat"" boundary. General rules of play: In a general two-player game, opponents sit across from each other at the board. In four-player partners, the partners sit across from each other (turns rotate clockwise). Players must make all their shots from their original seated position....you cannot get up and walk around the board to make a shot from a different shooting line. Furthermore, the shooting player must stay within the seat boundary defined by the diagonal lines on the board. Imagine those lines extending out to infinity. No part of the shooter's body may cross those boundary lines. Players use their fingers to flick a larger disc called a striker at the smaller discs (sometimes called ""men""). There is a special shot called a ""back shot"" where a player wants to shoot a disc that is between his shooting line and the rail closest to him. The rules prohibit the shooter from moving from his chair, so typically a back shot is made with the thumb propelling the striker backwards. To start play, the white, black and red queen pieces are ""racked"" in the center circle. The player who will ""break"" places the striker anywhere on the shooting line and flicks it at the pieces to ""break."" After each shot, the striker is RETURNED to the shooting line. Unlike pocket billiards where the cue ball is played from where it stops, in American Carrom, the striker is ALWAYS shot from the shooting line. A player continues to shoot until he misses. A disc on the edge of the pocket is considered in the pocket if it touches the bottom of the pocket hole. A disc sitting on the edge that is not in contact with the bottom of the hole is still in play.",carrom

The striker or the acrylic disc is meant for shooting the carrom men and dash them into the pockets In the carrom board rules, two parallel lines run covering all four sides. The striker must be placed in such a manner that it touches both the parallel lines every time the striker is placed to shoot a carrom man. . At the four corners of the carrom board near the pockets and attached to the baselines are four circles. When placing the striker, either the circles should not be touched at all or the striker has to be placed on the circle. You cannot place the striker in such a way that it touches both the parallel lines and the circle as well. . You can use only the index fingers, middle fingers and the thumbs of both the hands while playing. The thumb must be used for backward shots. You can do a Toss' to avoid confusion and the one who wins the toss will get the chance to strike first. . The teams strike one by one in the middle of the carrom men disc unless one of the teams strikes any one colour of the carrom men. For example, if player one manages to pocket a white carrom man, he will have to pocket all the white carrom men and or the queen as early as possible in order to win the match. The same rule is applied for player two as well Every player will get a single chance in one round.",carrom

1275,738,"COMMON CHESS OPENINGS HARK RETI OPENING The Reti opening (1. Nf3) is named after the great chess master Richard Reti. Like 1. d4 and 1. c4, the Reti also generally leads to closed positions, and all three moves can transpose into similar setups. One possible formation for white is the king's Indian attack. BRER BRI 1  FRENCH DEFENSE The French defense (1. e4, e6) concedes central space to white and limits the scope of his king's bishop but prevents tactics against 17 while al lowing black to have activity on the queenside and counterplay in the center. After the most typical line of 2. d4, d5, white's ""e"" pawn is immediately pressured, and white must decide how to deal with this. This leads to several variations including the exchange variation, ad- vance variation, Tarrasch variation, Winawer vari- ation, and classical variation. 11 AIRL QUEEN'S GAMBIT White players who prefer a quieter, more posi- tional game tend to prefer 1. d4 to 1. e4, after which the c4 break is the best way to play for an advantage either on the second move or soon after. The queen's gambit, marked by the moves 1. d4, d5 and 2. c4 is one of the oldest chess openings. This classical approach pre- tends to offer a pawn. In reality, black cannot expect to hold onto the pawn if the player chooses to capture it in exchange for a stron- ger center. Black has several options: the queeris gambit accepted, queen's gambit declined, and the Slav defense. 63 ABDAL PIRC DEFENSE Originally considered an inferior opening, the Pirc Defense (1. e4, d6) is now accepted as a solid choice. Black allows white to build an im- posing center, then attempts to turn that center into a target for attack. Some common variations of the Pirc defense in- clude the classical system and Austrian attack. ARRIRIRL ENGLISH OPENING The English opening is a flexible choice for white. The English often transposes into openings nor- mally seen after 1. d4, either exactly or with slight variations due to move order. You can also enter a ""reversed"" Sicilian defense if black re- sponds with e5, where white is playing the Sicil- lan defense with an extra tempo. One well-known setup that can arise from the En- glish opening is the Hedgehog defense. ARA ESRUL ITALIAN GAME First developed in the 1600s and perhaps the oldest chess opening, the Italian game also called the gluoco plano, the quiet game in Italian, is reached by the moves: 1. e4, e5; 2. Nf3, Nc6; and 3. Bc4. It remained popular through the 19th century but today has been supplanted by the Ruy Lopez as white's favorite choice on the third move. In this opening, Bc4 eyes black's potentially weak 17 pawn, but over the years, improved defensive techniques have shown this to be less dangerous to black than Bb5. Still, the Italian game often leads to aggressive, open positions, which can be fun to play. This open- ing is still used at all levels and is quite popular among club players. Variations in the Italian game include the two knights defense and the Hungarian defense. ARABARRI INDIAN DEFENSES After 1. d4, black is not obligated to play d5 in re- sponse. The best response to d4 is Nf6, which leads to a collection of openings known as the Indian defenses. These openings, while less solid than the classical d5, offer more immediate opportunities for counterplay. There are many popular lines arising after Nf6: the king's Indian defense, Nimzo-Indian defense, queen's Indian defense, and the Grunfeld defense. SICILIAN DEFENSE The Sicilian defense (1. e4, c5) is black's most popular response to e4, especially at the highest levels of chess. By playing c5, black immediately fights for the center and attacks d4 but avoids the symmetry of e5, The Sicilian defense typically leads to a complex and dangerous struggle where both sides can play for a win. There are many distinct variations in the Sicilian defense, each of which leads to different types of positions, they are the closed Sicilian, classical Sicilian, dragon variation, and Najdorf variation. X AXIRR EARTKE CARO-KANN DEFENSE Like the French defense, the Caro-Kann defense (1. e4, c6) prepares d5 on black's second move to challenge white's e4 pawn. The Caro-Kann is extremely solid but not as dynamic as many of black's other defenses against e4. Compared to the French, black has avoided blocking his king's bishop but will require a second move to play c5, a source of counterplay, where a player in a weaker position, essentially, fights back. Popular variations in the Caro-Kann include the classical variation, advance variation, exchange variation, and Panov-Botvinnik attack. RUY LOPEZ The Ruy Lopez -also known as the Spanish game-is named after Rodrigo (Ruy) Lopez de Segura, a Spanish bishop who analyzed this opening in his 1561 work, Libro de la Invencion Liberal y Arte del Juego del Axedrez, the ""Book of the Liberal Invention and Art of the Game of Chess. Nearly half a millennium later, the Ruy remains one of the most popular chess openings. Chess experts have come up with numerous variations, and a wide variety of strategic plans are available to both white and black. The starting position of the Ruy Lopez is reached after the following moves: 1. e4, e5;2. Nf3, Nc6; and 3. Bb5. Popular lines in the Ruy Lopez include but are not limited to the Morphy defense, Steinitz deferise, and the Berlin de- fense. Each of these and several other variations lead to numerous sub-variations.",chess

If the ball crosses the opposing team's goal line without being touched by the defending team that team may have a scrum at the half way. After a score the kick off is to be a drop kick TRY PENALTY GOAL DROP GOAL CONVERSION points Try An extensive review of the laws of Rugby Union in the aftermath of the 1991 World Cup has produced a number of changes which are to be implemented at the start of this season. These are primarily designed to increase the speed of the game and improve its safety record 5332 Line out Experimental change The present distance of half a metre between opposing lines of players is to be increased to 1 metre. Players of the same team no longer need to be 1 matre apart Tackle After tackle any off e payer not involved in the tackle must be on his feet when he plays the ball Mark A player only needs one foot on the ground and can call a mark when running Ruck and maul Experimental change to reduce mauling When the ball becomes unplayable in a ruck or a maul, or a maul becomes stationary, the team not in possession at the commencement will put the ball into a scrum Score increased to 5 points to encourage attacking play and emphasise importance over a penalty goal Scrum It is illegal to lift an opponent intentionally off his feet.

1929,181,". Touch Rugby Pitch Size The Rules Touch rugby is played on half the size of a rugby pitch with 6 players on each team. To stop an opponent all you have to do is touch them with ONE hand, an- ywhere from the shoulder downwards including the feet. If you are touched the rules are very similar to rugby league. You stop/ go back to the exact position you were first touched and roll the ball between your legs to the dummy half (scrum half name in touch rugby). After 6 touches if your team haven't scored a try it's a turnover and the other team start with the ball. The opposition must be back 5 metres when the roll ball occur otherwise they will give away a penalty and go back another 5 metres. NO KICKING at any time! Turn over restarted with roll ball if any of the following happen- Knock on Forward pass Ball touches floor Ball out of play 6 touches Dummy half gets touched or scores a try. Penalty Infringements: play starts with a tap & pass/go- Defenders offside at penalty tap or roll ball Obstruction (deliberately stopping opposition touch a team mate) Excessive force when making a touch Misconduct (may lead to sin bin). Each team must have at least 2 players from over at least 3 different year groups- Eg 2 Year 8's, 2 Year 9's, 2 Year 10's, Maximum squad of 7 with roll on, roll off subs. Each game is 10 mins long with no half time. GILBERT",rugby
1930,182,"The basic rules of rugby Rugby was born in 1823, when William Webb Ellis, while playing soccer, picked the ball up in his hands and ran with it to the goal The object of the game Passing the ball back and forth to each other, the players attempt to carry the ball into the end zone and ground it (a try) (1). After a try, the scoring team is awarded an additional kick (a conversion), which must be made from any point on an imaginary line (2) that runs parallel to the sidelines through where the ball was touched down. A team can also earn points by kicking the ball over the goal crossbar either from a penalty kick or in open play (a drop goal) (3) Running time of the game Two halves of 40 continuous minutes each. After 40 minutes, the game continues until the ball is 'dead' (leaves the field, etc.) Number of players on the field 15 players per team Scoring Try - 5 points Conversion - 2 points Drop goal - 3 points Penalty goal - 3 points Pass The ball can only be passed by hand backwards or parallel to the goal line (forward passing by hand is not allowed). The ball can be kicked forward, but only the kicker, or a player who was behind the kicker at the time of the kick, is allowed to catch it What you need to know: RIANOVOSTI 2011 WWW.RIA.RU The length of the field is no more than 100 meters In-goal area 1 The ball 22-meter line Halfway line 22-meter line 2 The in-goal area is between 10 and 22 meters in length 28-30 sm Dead ball line 3 15 sm Dead ball line Goal line 10-meter line 10-meter line Goal line The width of the field is no more than 70 meters Sideline Rugby balls are made mainly of rubber, leather and similar materials. The surface is rough, and the ball weighs 410-460 grams The ruck is a phase of play where one or more players from each team are bound over the ball, which is on the ground between them. The aim of the ruck is for the players to roll the ball with their feet to their teammates behind them The maul is similar to the ruck, except the ball is not on the ground but is in the hands of one of the players The scrum takes place after certain infringements. The purpose of the scrum is the same - to send the ball to the teammates behind, using feet only The lineout is a throw-in after the ball leaves the side of the field. Here, players from both teams form lines, and a player throws the ball between them. Usually, one player is lifted up by their teammates in order to catch the ball",rugby

Respect Rugby traditions and values are respected. For example, players and coaches are respected, match officials and their decisions are respected and rugby pitches, equipment and clubhouses are respected. Enjoyment Rugby training keeps you fit and healthy. It helps you learn skills you can use in your life. People should play rugby for all of these reasons but mostly because they enjoy it. Being part of the rugby family is fun. Discipline Discipline is a way of teaching people how to behave in certain situations. There are many rugby rules that need to be followed to keep people safe. Players who break the rules are disciplined. This could mean they receive a warning or have to leave the pitch.

1999,249,"Overview -Tag Rugby is an invasion game in which two teams play against each other. In tag rugby, players carry the ball using their hands. The aim is to ground the ball in goal areas. -Teams have six plays to do so: being 'tagged' when in possession of the ball ends one play. -The ball can only be passed backwards or sidewards to teammates, but can be kicked forwards (the receiver must be behind the ball). -In lower KS2 rugby, we learn how to keep possession, pass, catch, dodge, tag and score. We also develop strategies to collectively succeed. Skill Carrying to H Passing Catching TO Supporting Tagging Always try to follow the rules of the game. Definition To move with the ball in your hands. To send the ball to a teammate by throwing it to them. TAG RUGBY KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER Social and Emotional To receive and hold possession of the ball with the hands. To help a teammate who has the ball. To touch the player in possession of the ball. Physical How do I do this? -Carry the ball in two hands, allowing for quicker passes in any direction. Run when defenders are not too close. -Where needed, try to dodge past defenders by pushing off your outside foot to change direction. You can't block your tag. Run to spaces where there are no defenders. -Create a W shape with hands on the ball. -Hands on the side of the ball, fingers spread out. -Stand sideways on to your receiver. Swing your arms back and forth like a pendulum. Release the ball with your arms pointing towards the receiver. -Move your feet to get in line with the ball. -Eyes on the ball. Hands out to meet the ball. -Catch the ball on its width (sides). Bring it under control by moving the ball in towards your body. Be aware of the people and space around you. -Move with your teammate as they are running with the ball, so that you are ready to receive a pass. -Keep space between yourself and the ball carrier, so that they have space to pass. Stay behind/ sidewards to ball. -Make sure that you are close enough to the player in possession before reaching for the tag. -When successful, hold the tag in the air and shout 'tag."" -Hand back the tag to the player when they return. Store equipment safely when it is not in use. Ensure that you keep your eyes on the ball. Cooperation Cooperating is about working together. Strong teams need each individual to cooperate with teammates. Remember to pass to teammates and not keep the ball when it is not best for the team. Supporting and Encouraging Encouraging and supporting others can help them to feel good and perform well. Try to help everyone stay sup positive by saying and doing the right things when playing sport with others. Honesty and Fair Play Fair play is about learning the rules of the game and putting them into practice honestly. Be honest when you or your teammates are tagging or have been tagged. Games are not as much fun when not played fairly. Inclusion Inclusion is about proactively including everyone. People of all backgrounds and abilities can enjoy tag rugby and contribute to teams. Encourage team mates and welcome everyone's participation. Thinking/ Strategic Goal Area - The area in which your team needs to ground the ball in order to get points. Forward Pass - An illegal pass in which the ball is passed forwards through the hands to a teammate. Penalised with a free pass to the other team. Health and Safety In tag rugby, do not attempt contact rugby tackles. You could injure yourself or others. Respect and Kindness Respect is the act of giving attention and showing care to others. It is important to be respectful to teammates, opponents, referees and coaches. It is important to be inclusive of others, respecting people of all abilities and experience levels. Managing Emotions Whilst it is important try your hardest, you should remember that games and sports should be fun. Be considerate to others in victory and be respectful and gracious in defeat. Make sure that you warm up properly. Offside - When a tag is made, all defenders must get back in front of the ball. Players behind are 'offside.' Defenders cannot block or intercept the first pass after a tag. Tag Belt - A Velcro belt to which tags are attached. Lower KS2 An Stretch your muscles before exercising. Key Vocabulary Tag Rugby Rugby Ball Invasion Game Ground Warm down after exercising. Goal Area Back/ Forward Pass Tag Carry Dodge Offside Inclusion Cooperation Fair Play/ Honesty -Success in rugby is about finding the right strategies to succeed against your opponents. Attack space and do not run directly at defenders. The most important idea is to run forward! -When others have the ball, don't switch off! Move into space to help your teammates. When defending, ensure that you stay onside, and close off the space to minimise point-scoring opportunities. Remove jewellery and wear suitable clothing/ equipment.",rugby
